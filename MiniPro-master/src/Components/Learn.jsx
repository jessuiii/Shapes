        <h3>Rectangle</h3>
        <p>The rectangle is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides of equal length and four right angles. Its area is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. Rectangles find wide usage in architecture, engineering, and design due to their regularity and ease of measurement. They are prevalent in buildings, windows, doors, and various construction projects.</p>

        <h3>Square</h3>
        <p>A square is a special type of rectangle with all four sides of equal length and four right angles. Its area is calculated by squaring the length of one side. Squares are fundamental in geometry and are extensively applied in fields like mathematics, art, and construction. Their equal sides and angles make them ideal for tiles, flooring, and geometric patterns.</p>

        <h3>Circle</h3>
        <p>The circle is a perfectly round shape with a constant radius from the center to any point on its circumference. Its area is calculated using the formula πr<sup>2</sup>, where 'r' represents the radius. Circles have vital applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering, appearing in areas such as wheels, gears, orbits, and structural design.</p>

        <h3>Triangle</h3>
        <p>Triangles are three-sided polygons with various types based on their angles and sides. Their area is determined by various formulas such as ½ base × height for a right-angled triangle or Heron's formula for any triangle given the three side lengths. Triangles are fundamental in trigonometry, architecture, and engineering, often seen in roof designs, bridges, and trusses.</p>

        <h3>Regular Pentagon</h3>
        <p>A regular pentagon is a five-sided polygon with equal sides and angles. Its area can be calculated using specialized formulas like (1/4) × √(5 × (5 + 2√5)) × side<sup>2</sup>. Regular pentagons are found in nature in star shapes and are used in architecture and design for creating unique patterns, such as in quilting or decorative tiles</p>

        <h3>Regular Octagon</h3>
        <p>A regular octagon, an eight-sided polygon with equal sides and angles measuring 135 degrees each, shares similarities with the regular hexagon but boasts eight sides. With symmetrical properties and rotational symmetry of order 8, this geometric shape finds diverse applications. Its uniformity in side length allows for architectural elegance in structures like the Tower of the Winds, while its symmetrical nature lends itself to decorative tiles and mathematical patterns. Additionally, in engineering, it serves as a design element for nuts, bolts, and gears due to its symmetrical attributes. The area of a regular octagon can be calculated using the formula (2 + 2√2) × s<sup>2</sup>, where 's' represents the length of a side, or by breaking it into smaller shapes, simplifying the area calculation. This versatility makes the regular octagon a versatile and visually appealing shape across various fields</p>
